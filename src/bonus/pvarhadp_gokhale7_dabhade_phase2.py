# # # The code implements an age prediction model using the XGBoost regression algorithm, leveraging various health and lifestyle features from a dataset. Initially, the code separates the target variable, "Age (years)," from the feature set and splits the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. The XGBoost model is defined and hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomizedSearchCV, optimizing parameters such as the number of estimators, maximum depth, learning rate, and subsampling strategies. After fitting the model to the training data, it evaluates performance using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared metrics. The results indicate a MAE of approximately 0.061, an MSE of about 0.006, and an R-squared value of approximately 0.93, reflecting a strong predictive capability and minimal error in age predictions. For a set of sample normalized features, the model predicts an age of 72 years for an actual age of 69 years. Overall, the model demonstrates high accuracy and effective learning from the dataset, making it a valuable tool for age prediction based on health indicators.
